You need to do this in order to play Kaizo Mario Galaxy on USB Loader GX. (USA only, no need to do this on EUR)

NOTE: I highly recommend changing the Game ID as well as the TMD ID in the builder,
this way the Wii will create a separate save file for Kaizo

1. Move the 'txtcodes' folder to your Wii's SD Card
2. Enable 'Ocarina' in 'Game Load' settings for Kaizo Mario Galaxy
3. Below the 'Game Load button there should be a button called 'Ocarina', press it
4. Turn on 'StarbitReset' and press create
