**__Thank you for using my Iso Builder for Kaizo Mario Galaxy__**

**What it is**

A iso builder for Kaizo Mario Galaxy, a SMG mod.

**Requirements**

Wiimm's ISO Tools (or WIT for short), you can get it here: https://wit.wiimm.de/

**Usage**

- Place a .iso file (.wbfs, .wdf, .wia and some other formats also supported) of SMG into the iso builder folder and run Builder.bat.

- There are instructions on-screen but if you just want an .iso to use on dolphin:
	1. Choose 1, 2, 3 or 4  (in this case choose 1).
	2. Type in the name of your SMG disc image (e. g. SMG.iso).
	3. Type in a name for the new, modded SMG disc image. (e. g. Kaizo Mario Galaxy.iso)
	4. Wait until the modded disc image finishes building.
	5. Follow the steps in 'Dolphin Guide.txt' or if you're playing on a USB Loader, follow 'USB Loader GX Guide.txt'
